# Non-Existent OS - The Most Secure Operating System

Today I announce the creation of a project I have been thinking about for a while now and that is Non existent OS (NE OS). NE OS is an operating system with only security in mind. I realised that the problem that is inherent in all modern day operating systems is that they exist and therefore there is always the possibility of a vulnerability. However if the operating system does not exist then the vulnerability would also have to not exist for it to work, but if it doesn't exist how can you say there is a vulnerability? Therefore there is no possible vulnerability for NE OS.

## What does NE OS offer? 

NE OS offers eveything that every past, present and future operating system can possibly offer except that it is all non-existent within NE OS.

## Benefits of using NE OS

You can rest easy knowing that you own an operating system that is free from the worries of malware, bugs, spyware, and just about any negative thing that can occur on a computer.

## Live demo:





## Download

To download NE OS you must enter the realm of non-existense, because I am operating in the realm of existent it is not possible for me to give a download link. 
Please don't ask me how to enter non-existense, I can indeed confirm that it is very possible to enter the realm of non-existense, but I myself don't know.

## Where is the source code?

NE OS does not exist and so its source code also does not exist

## Furture of NE OS

The future of NE OS can not be desribed as it does not exist and therefore lives outside of our perception of time.

## How you can support NE OS

The first thing you can do is to tell your friends about the existense of an operating system that doesn't exist - NE OS!

donations are NOT accepted because the cost of maintaining this operating system is non existent

feedback about NE OS is much appreciated please feel free to leave a git pull request 

If anyone wants to start a CTF with NE OS feel free, but don't waste your time. 

## FAQ

How is it possible for someone to make something that doesn't exist?

I argue that because I conceived of the idea that it exists that means I made it, as in the idea of an operating system that doesn't exist - NE OS is something that does exist. Although I don't believe in any kind of copyright or IP as how can you copyright as idea? Therefore feel free to claim this idea as your own, but know that it is the idea that matters, not the person presenting the idea.

Can't all problems be solved by making x thing non-existent?

How can you turn something that exists into something that does not? Destroying it doesn't make it no longer exist, it just redistributes the parts that made it was it was and you can also argue that it still exists as a memory. Therefore I don't believe it is possible to turn something that doesn't exist into something that doesn't. Although I am open to the idea that it is possible. But surely to measure this you would need to exist in a place outside of existence and non-existense. I don't know.
